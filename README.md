## Introduction:
Here, in this repository, I aim to analyze video game sales with the idea of presenting this to a board of directors regarding the future of video game sales. Beginning by analysing the top video games sold in the perspective of the global market. Allowing for us to then continue to analyse the frequency in terms of the top selling genres and video game publishers. Furthermore I shall analyse market trends in terms of growing regions. Determining the most profitable and growing trends regarding highest percentage of population to units sold.

 

## Objectives:
- Calculate the Global contribution for each Platform from each Region
- Calculate the total Global sales
- Top 5 performing genres in each region
- Top 5 performing publishers in each region
- Top 5 performing platforms in each region
- Genres gaining the most popularity globally
- Publishers gaining the most popularity globally
- The top performing game
- The top performing game series
- Connections between the top perfomring game series and the top performing game genres
