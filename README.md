# Video-Game-Sales-Analysis

## Introduction:
Here, in this repository, I aim to analyse video game sales with the idea of presenting this to a board of directors regarding the future of video game sales. Beginning by analysing the top video games sold in the perspective of the global market. Allowing for us to then continue to analyse the frequency in terms of the top selling genres and video game publishers. Furthermore I shall analyse market trends in terms of growing regions. Determining the most profitable and growing trends regarding highest percentage of population to units sold.

## Objectives:

### General calculation graphics:
- Calculate the Global contribution for each Platform from each Region
- Calculate the total Global sales

### Analysis:
- Top 5 performing genres in each region - [X] 
- Top 5 performing publishers in each region - [X] 
- Top 5 performing platforms in each region - [X] 
- Genres gaining the most popularity globally 
- Connections between the top performing game series and the top performing game genres

## Results:
You can see the raw Microsoft Excel file [here](https://github.com/sinhcoshtanh/video_game_sales_excel/blob/e9afab102ac453941ceb8ca082137912b977e033/dashboards.xlsx). This will include all of the Pivot Tables and VLOOKUP features in addition to the most important aspect of the file, the dashboard file which is found under the 'dashboard' tab underneath.

## Discussion:
### Top 5 performing genres in each region

Comparing the regions, we notice that for the regions of Europe, North America, and over Global sales, we notice that they all maintain the same top 3 performing genres, Action, Sports, and Shooter. However, after this we notice that there is a rather different preceding genres. With Europe: Racing and Misc, North America: Platform and Misc, and Global sales: Role-Playing and Platform. As we see, the similarity of the regions after the top 3 is position 5 with Misc. We can see that Europe holds racing within their top 3 genres, it could be said that this is due to the popularity of motor sports such as Formula 1, Formula E, World Endurance Championship, World Rally Championship, Le Mans, and Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters.
